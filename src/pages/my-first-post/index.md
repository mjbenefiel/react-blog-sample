## Blog, flashcards and central hub...
 Moving forward, I'd like to create one central site for my blog, flash cards, etc., so that I may document my journey as I dive into my new position as a solutions engineer. This will also be an "easy" way to stay active on GitHub. Documenting my experiences is paramount, though.
